        <h2>What Actually Is Luciferin?</h2><br><br><hr>
        <p>Luciferin (from the Latin lucifer, "light-bearer") is a generic term for the light-emitting compound found in organisms
        that generate bioluminescence. Luciferins typically undergo an enzyme-catalyzed reaction with molecular oxygen. The
        resulting transformation, which usually involves splitting off a molecular fragment, produces an excited state
        intermediate that emits light upon decaying to its ground state. The term may refer to molecules that are substrates for
        both luciferases and photoproteins.</p>

        <p>You see, fireflies contain a chemical in their abdomen called luciferin. When that chemical combines with oxygen and
        with an enzyme called luciferase,<p> the ensuing chemical reaction causes their abdomen to light up.</p> This light is referred
        to as bioluminescence, which is when a chemical light is produced by a reaction within a living organism.</p>
